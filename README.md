# Midterm Project: Student Record Manager

## Description / Overview
This midterm project is a simple Student Record Manager CLI application that demonstrates the skills learned in the course. It lets you add, list, search, update, and delete student records stored in a local JSON file. The README is written to be beginner friendly for people using Git and GitHub from the terminal for the first time.

## Objectives
- Practice using Git and GitHub from the terminal.
- Build a working program with input/output handling and file storage.
- Practice data validation and error handling.
- Write clear documentation and share the project on GitHub.

## Features / Functionality
- Add new student records (name, id, email).
- List all student records.
- Search records by ID or name.
- Update and delete records.
- Persistent storage using a local JSON file.
- Simple, user-friendly CLI commands.
